# Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. 
# Write a class called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in 
# Exercise 9-3 (page 162) or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). Add an attribute, 
# privileges, that stores a list of strings like 
# "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on. 
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the 
# administratorâ€™s set 
# of privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
