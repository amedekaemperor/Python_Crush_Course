# Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and 
# last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in 
# a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. 
# Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.
