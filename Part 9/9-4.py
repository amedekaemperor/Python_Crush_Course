# Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). 
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and 
# then change this value and print it again.
#  Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
#  customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and 
#  print the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the 
# number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number 
# you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, 
# a day of business.
