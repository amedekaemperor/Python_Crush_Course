# Privileges: Write a separate Privileges class. 
# The class should have one attribute, privileges, that stores a list of 
# strings as described in Exercise 9-7. Move the show_privileges() method 
# to this class. Make a Privileges instance as an attribute in the Admin class. 
# Create a new instance of Admin and use your method to show its privileges.
