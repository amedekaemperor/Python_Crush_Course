# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. 
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return 
# a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three 
# dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that 
# the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() 
# that allows you to store the number of songs on an album. 
# If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, 
# add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that includes the number 
# of songs on an album.
